## Deformable Convolutional Networks V2 with Pytorch 1.X

### Build
```bash
    ./make.sh         # build
    python testcpu.py    # run examples and gradient check on cpu
    python testcuda.py   # run examples and gradient check on gpu 
```

This repo adds cpu functionality to DCNv2 PyTorch by Charles Shang which is  an adaption of the official [Deformable-ConvNets](https://github.com/msracver/Deformable-ConvNets/tree/master/DCNv2_op).
