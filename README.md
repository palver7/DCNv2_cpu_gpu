## Deformable Convolutional Networks V2 For CPU and GPU with PyTorch 1.0

### Build
```bash
    ./make.sh         # build
    python testcpu.py     # run examples and gradient check on CPU
    python testcuda.py    # run examples and gradient check on CUDA GPU
```
### Note
This repository is based on https://github.com/CharlesShang/DCNv2. I noticed that DCNv2 may have problems with PyTorch 1.4 so I uploaded a previous version of DCNv2 for CPU and GPU that works with PyTorch 1.0. If you are interested in using this repository, please ensure you have the correct version of PyTorch and TorchVision.
